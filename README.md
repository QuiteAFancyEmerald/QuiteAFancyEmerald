I mostly go by Crystal now! 
Quite A Fancy Emerald or Em if you would like also :D

**Well here are some things about me:**

- I like watching anime... maybe too much of it.
- Probably also spend too much time working on Holy Unblocker.
- Gotta love Hollow Knight ðŸŽ®

**Quite A Fancy Emerald#0001** is my discord if you feel like talking.

On a serious note though I have worked on various projects including Holy Unblocker.

Overall though I like to do fun projects in my free time.
