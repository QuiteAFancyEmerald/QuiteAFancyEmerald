# Quite A Fancy Emerald
### Hai! I'm an Emerald. (a fancy one pew pew)

And yes I go by Quite A Fancy Emerald or Em if you would like.

Well here are some things about me:

- I like watching anime... maybe too much of it. Don't ask what my favorite is! 🌺
- I enjoy working with Java and C#. I also like to do many fun projects. 🌱
- Also a game developer who mains in C#. 🎐
- Gotta love Hollow Knight >:DD 🎮
- I wish I had a llama. 🦙
- Quite A Fancy Emerald#0001 is my discord if you feel like talking. 💬

Overall though I mostly like to do fun projects in my free time. Web Development is an interest of mine and I love modding games.

On a serious note though I have worked on various projects including Holy Unblocker (my most recent one) as well as a mod called More Biomes Plus with more to come.

Fun Fact: I'm an Emerald. A fancy one.
